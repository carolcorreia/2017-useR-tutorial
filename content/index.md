We are excited to announce that our [workshop proposal](proposal/) "Open and
Reproducible Research with R" has been accepted as a tutorial
for [useR!2017](http://www.user2017.brussels/), Brussels. The tutorial session
will take place on July 4th, 2017.

The content of this workshop will be a condensed version of a workshop Data
Carpentry teaches in 2 days that introduces best practices for Reproducible
Science with R. This will be an opportunity for you to learn more about this
topic, and to experience the teaching style of Data Carpentry workshops.
